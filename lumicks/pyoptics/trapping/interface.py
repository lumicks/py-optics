    Calculate the three-dimensional electromagnetic field of a bead the

    This function correctly incorporates the polarized nature of light in a
    focus. In other words, the polarization state at the focus includes
    electric fields in the x, y, and z directions. The input is taken to be
    polarized along the x direction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    beam_power : power of the laser beam before entering the objective, in
        Watt.
    filling_factor : filling factor of the Gaussian beam over the
        aperture, defined as w0/R. Here, w0 is the waist of the Gaussian
        beam and R is the radius of the aperture. Range 0...Inf
    objective : instance of the Objective class.
    bead: instance of the Bead class
    x : array of x locations for evaluation, in meters
    y : array of y locations for evaluation, in meters

        in meters
    bfp_sampling_n : (Default value = 31) Number of discrete steps with
        which the back focal plane is sampled, from the center to the edge.
        The total number of plane waves scales with the square of
        bfp_sampling_n
    num_orders : number of order that should be included in the
        calculation the Mie solution. If it is None (default), the code will
        use the number_of_orders() method to calculate a sufficient number.
    return_grid: (Default value = False) return the sampling grid in the
        matrices X, Y and Z
    total_field : If True, return the total field of incident and
        scattered electromagnetic field (default). If False, then only
        return the scattered field outside the bead. Inside the bead, the
        full field is always returned.
    magnetic_field : If True, return the magnetic fields as well. If false
        (default), do not return the magnetic fields.
    verbose : If True, print statements on the progress of the calculation.
        Default is False
    grid: If True (default), interpret the vectors or scalars x, y and z as
        the input for the numpy.meshgrid function, and calculate the fields
        at the locations that are the result of the numpy.meshgrid output.
        If False, interpret the x, y and z vectors as the exact locations
        where the field needs to be evaluated. In that case, all vectors
        need to be of the same length.

    Calculate the three-dimensional electromagnetic field of a bead in the
    focus of an arbitrary input beam, going through an objective with a certain
    NA and focal length. Implemented with the angular spectrum of plane waves
    and Mie theory.

    This function correctly incorporates the polarized nature of light in a
    focus. In other words, the polarization state at the focus includes
    electric fields in the x, y, and z directions. The input can be a
    combination of x- and y-polarized light of complex amplitudes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f_input_field : function with signature `f(aperture, x_bfp, y_bfp, r_bfp,
        r_max, bfp_sampling_n)`, where `x_bfp` is a grid of x locations in the
        back focal plane, determined by the focal length and NA of the
        objective. `y_bfp` is the corresponding grid of y locations, and
        `r_bfp` is the radial distance from the center of the back focal plane.
        r_max is the largest distance that falls inside the NA, but r_bfp will
        contain larger numbers as the back focal plane is sampled with a square
        grid. The function must return a tuple (Ex, Ey), which are the electric
        fields in the x- and y- direction, respectively, at the sample
        locations in the back focal plane. The fields may be complex, so a
        phase difference between x and y is possible. If only one polarization
        is used, the other return value must be None, e.g., y polarization
        would return (None, Ey). The fields are post-processed such that any
        part that falls outside of the NA is set to zero. This region is
        indicated by the variable `aperture`, which has the same shape as
        `x_bfp`, `y_bfp` and `r_bfp`, and for every location indicates whether
        it is inside the NA of the objective with `True` or outside the NA with
        `False`. The integer `bfp_sampling_n` is the number of samples of the
        back focal plane from the center to the edge of the NA, and is given
        for convenience or potential caching. This will be the number as passed

    Calculate the forces on a bead in the focus of an arbitrary input
    beam, going through an objective with a certain NA and focal length.
    Implemented with the angular spectrum of plane waves and Mie theory.

    This function correctly incorporates the polarized nature of light in a
    focus. In other words, the polarization state at the focus includes
    electric fields in the x, y, and z directions. The input can be a
    combination of x- and y-polarized light of complex amplitudes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f_input_field : function with signature f(X_BFP, Y_BFP, R, Rmax,
        cosTheta, cosPhi, sinPhi), where X_BFP is a grid of x locations in
        the back focal plane, determined by the focal length and NA of the
        objective. Y_BFP is the corresponding grid of y locations, and R is
        the radial distance from the center of the back focal plane. Rmax is
        the largest distance that falls inside the NA, but R will contain
        larger numbers as the back focal plane is sampled with a square
        grid. Theta is defined as the angle with the negative optical axis
        (-z), and cosTheta is the cosine of this angle. Phi is defined as
        the angle between the x and y axis, and cosPhi and sinPhi are its
        cosine and sine, respectively. The function must return a tuple
        (E_BFP_x, E_BFP_y), which are the electric fields in the x- and y-
        direction, respectively, at the sample locations in the back focal
        plane. The fields may be complex, so a phase difference between x
        and y is possible. If only one polarization is used, the other
        return value must be None, e.g., y polarization would return (None,
        E_BFP_y). The fields are post-processed such that any part that
        falls outside of the NA is set to zero.
    objective : instance of the Objective class
    bead : instance of the Bead class
    bead_center : tuple of three floating point numbers determining the
        x, y and z position of the bead center in 3D space, in meters
    bfp_sampling_n : (Default value = 31) Number of discrete steps with
        which the back focal plane is sampled, from the center to the edge.
        The total number of plane waves scales with the square of
        bfp_sampling_n num_orders: number of order that should be included
        in the calculation the Mie solution. If it is None (default), the
        code will use the number_of_orders() method to calculate a
        sufficient number.

    Returns
    -------

        y direction F[1] and in the z direction F[2]. The force is in [N].
