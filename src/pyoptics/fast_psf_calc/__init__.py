    This function correctly incorporates the polarized nature of light in a
    focus. In other words, the polarization state at the focus includes electric
    fields in the x, y, and z directions. The input can be any arbitrary
    polarization in the XY plane.

    Args:
      f_input_field: function with signature
        f(X_BFP, Y_BFP, R, Rmax, Theta, Phi), where X_BFP is a grid of x
        locations in the back focal plane, determined by the focal length and NA
        of the objective. Y_BFP is the corresponding grid of y locations, and R
        is the radial distance from the center of the back focal plane. Rmax is
        the largest distance that falls inside the NA, but R will contain larger
        numbers as the back focal plane is sampled with a square grid. Theta is
        defined as the angle with the optical axis (z), and Phi is defined as
        the angle between the x and y axis. The function must return a tuple
        (E_BFP_x, E_BFP_y), which are the electric fields in the x- and y-
        direction, respectively, at the sample locations in the back focal
        plane. The fields may be complex, so a phase difference between x and y
        is possible. If only one polarization is used, the other return value
        must be None, e.g., y polarization would return (None, E_BFP_y). The
        fields are post-processed such that any part that falls outside of the
        NA is set to zero.
