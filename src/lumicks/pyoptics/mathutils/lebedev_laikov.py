    order : int
        Order to check against. Must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    nearest_order : int
        The nearest order with known coordinates and coefficients.

        result.

    is thrown. Permissible values are: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 35,

    Since scipy version 1.15 included the integration scheme natively, this function just wraps
    `scipy.integrate.lebedev_rule`. The original version included with Py-optics used weight factors
    such that np.sum(w) == 1.0. Scipy uses the convention np.sum(w) = 4Ï€. This function converts the
    returned weight factors such that np.sum(w) == 1.0, for consistency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : int
        Integration order to get the integration and weight factors for.

    Returns
    -------
    x, y, z, w : tuple
        Tuple of lists with the x, y and z locations of the integration coordinates, and the weight
        factors `w` to go with it.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        Raises an exception if `order` is not in the set of permissible values.
