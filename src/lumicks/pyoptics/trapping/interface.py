    This function correctly incorporates the polarized nature of light in a focus. In other words,
    the polarization state at the focus includes electric fields in the x, y, and z directions. The
    input can be a combination of x- and y-polarized light of complex amplitudes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f_input_field : callable
        function with signature `f(aperture, x_bfp, y_bfp, r_bfp, r_max, bfp_sampling_n)`, where
        `x_bfp` is a grid of x locations in the back focal plane, determined by the focal length and
        NA of the objective. `y_bfp` is the corresponding grid of y locations, and `r_bfp` is the
        radial distance from the center of the back focal plane. r_max is the largest distance that
        falls inside the NA, but r_bfp will contain larger numbers as the back focal plane is
        sampled with a square grid. The function must return a tuple (Ex, Ey), which are the
        electric fields in the x- and y- direction, respectively, at the sample locations in the
        back focal plane. The fields may be complex, so a phase difference between x and y is
        possible. If only one polarization is used, the other return value must be None, e.g., y
        polarization would return (None, Ey). The fields are post-processed such that any part that
        falls outside of the NA is set to zero. This region is indicated by the variable `aperture`,
        which has the same shape as `x_bfp`, `y_bfp` and `r_bfp`, and for every location indicates
        whether it is inside the NA of the objective with `True` or outside the NA with `False`. The
        integer `bfp_sampling_n` is the number of samples of the back focal plane from the center to
        the edge of the NA, and is given for convenience or potential caching. This will be the

    Calculate the forces on a bead in the focus of an arbitrary input
    beam, going through an objective with a certain NA and focal length.

    This function correctly incorporates the polarized nature of light in a
    focus. In other words, the polarization state at the focus includes
    electric fields in the x, y, and z directions. The input can be a
    combination of x- and y-polarized light of complex amplitudes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f_input_field : function with signature f(X_BFP, Y_BFP, R, Rmax,
        cosTheta, cosPhi, sinPhi), where X_BFP is a grid of x locations in
        the back focal plane, determined by the focal length and NA of the
        objective. Y_BFP is the corresponding grid of y locations, and R is
        the radial distance from the center of the back focal plane. Rmax is
        the largest distance that falls inside the NA, but R will contain
        larger numbers as the back focal plane is sampled with a square
        grid. Theta is defined as the angle with the negative optical axis
        (-z), and cosTheta is the cosine of this angle. Phi is defined as
        the angle between the x and y axis, and cosPhi and sinPhi are its
        cosine and sine, respectively. The function must return a tuple
        (E_BFP_x, E_BFP_y), which are the electric fields in the x- and y-
        direction, respectively, at the sample locations in the back focal
        plane. The fields may be complex, so a phase difference between x
        and y is possible. If only one polarization is used, the other
        return value must be None, e.g., y polarization would return (None,
        E_BFP_y). The fields are post-processed such that any part that
        falls outside of the NA is set to zero.
    objective : instance of the Objective class
    bead : instance of the Bead class
    bead_center : tuple of three floating point numbers determining the
        x, y and z position of the bead center in 3D space, in meters
    bfp_sampling_n : (Default value = 31) Number of discrete steps with
        which the back focal plane is sampled, from the center to the edge.
        The total number of plane waves scales with the square of
        bfp_sampling_n num_orders: number of order that should be included
        in the calculation the Mie solution. If it is None (default), the
        code will use the number_of_orders() method to calculate a
        sufficient number.

    Returns
    -------
    F : an array with the force on the bead in the x direction F[0], in the
        y direction F[1] and in the z direction F[2]. The force is in [N].
