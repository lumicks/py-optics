    Calculate the three-dimensional electromagnetic field of a bead the focus of a of a Gaussian
    beam, using the angular spectrum of plane waves and Mie theory [1]_[2]_.

    This function correctly incorporates the polarized nature of light in a focus. In other words,
    the polarization state at the focus includes electric fields in the x, y, and z directions. The
    input is taken to be polarized along the x direction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    beam_power : float
        Power of the laser beam before entering the objective, in Watt.
    filling_factor : float
        Filling factor of the Gaussian beam over the aperture, defined as w0/R. Here, w0 is the
        waist of the Gaussian beam and R is the radius of the aperture. Range 0...Inf
    objective : Objective
        Instance of the Objective class.
    bead: Bead
        Instance of the Bead class
    x : float | ArrayLike
        array of x locations for evaluation, in meters
    y : float | ArrayLike
        array of y locations for evaluation, in meters
    z : float | ArrayLike
        array of z locations for evaluation, in meters
    bead_center : tuple[float, float, float]
        A tuple of three floating point numbers determining the x, y and z position of the bead
        center in 3D space, in meters
    return_grid: bool, optional
        Return the sampling grid (the result of np.meshgrid) in the matrices X, Y and Z. Default
        is False
    total_field : bool, optional
        If True, return the total field (sum) of incident and scattered electromagnetic field
        (default). If False, then only return the scattered field outside the bead. Inside the bead,
        the full field is always returned.
    magnetic_field : bool, optional
        If True, return the magnetic fields and the electric fields. If false (default), do not
        return the magnetic fields, but only the electric fields.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, print statements on the progress of the calculation. Default is False
    grid: bool, optional
        If True (default), interpret the vectors or scalars x, y and z as the input for the
        numpy.meshgrid function, and calculate the fields at the locations that are the result of
        the numpy.meshgrid output. If False, interpret the x, y and z vectors as the exact locations
        where the field needs to be evaluated. In that case, all vectors need to be of the same
        length.
    num_spherical_modes : int, optional
        Number of order that should be included in the calculation the Mie solution. If it is `None`
        (default), the code will use the :py:method:`Bead.number_of_modes()` method to calculate a
        sufficient number.
    integration_order_bfp : int | None
        Order of the method to integrate over the back focal plane of the objective. Typically, the
        higher the order, the more accurate the result, or the region of convergence expands. If
        `None`, the function tries to figure out a reasonable default value for the integration
        methods "peirce" (default, see below) and "equidistant". For other integration methods the
        order has to be set by hand.
    integration_method_bfp : str, optional
        The method of integrating over the back focal plane. The default is "peirce", which is a
        Gaussian-Legendre-like integration method. Other options are "lether", "equidistant" and
        "takaki", see notes below.

    Calculate the three-dimensional electromagnetic field of a bead in the focus of an arbitrary

    objective : Objective
        instance of the Objective class
    bead : Bead

    integration_order_bfp : int

        higher the order, the more accurate the result, or the region of convergence of the area
        around the focus expands. The order has to be provided, but if the region of interest is
        known in advance, the :py:method:`Objective.minimal_integration_order` method can help to
        determine a reasonable starting value, though it only supports the integration methods
        "peirce" and "equidistant" (see below).
    integration_method_bfp : str
        The method of integrating over the back focal plane. The default is "peirce", which is a
        Gaussian-Legendre-like integration method. Other options are "lether", "equidistant" and
        "takaki", see notes below.
    num_spherical_modes : int
        Number of orders that should be included in the calculation the Mie solution. If it is None

        The order of the integration. If no order is given, the code will determine an order based
        on the number of orders in the Mie solution. If the integration order is provided, that
        order is used for Gauss-Legendre integration. For Lebedev-Laikov integration, that order or
        the nearest higher order is used when the provided order does not match one of the available
        orders. The automatic determination of the integration order sets `integration_order` to
        `num_spherical_modes + 1` for Gauss-Legendre integration, and to `2 * num_spherical_modes`

    spherical_integration_method : string, optional

        faster for similar precision. However, the order is limited to 131. The Gauss-Legendre
        integration scheme is the next most efficient, but may have issues at a very high
        integration order. In that case, the Clenshaw-Curtis method may be used.

    ----------

        see :py:class:`pyoptics.objective.BackFocalPlaneCoordinates` and

        are the electric fields in the x- and y- direction, respectively, at the sample locations in
        the back focal plane. The fields may be complex, so a phase difference between x and y is
        possible. If only one polarization is used, the other return value must be None, e.g., y
        polarization would return (None, Ey). The fields are post-processed such that any part that
        falls outside of the NA is set to zero.

        Instance of the Objective class
    bead : Bead
        Instance of the Bead class

        (List of) three floating point numbers determining the x, y and z position of the bead
        center in 3D space, in meters.
    num_spherical_modes : int
        Number of order that should be included in the calculation the Mie solution. If it is `None`
        (default), the code will use the :py:method:`Bead.number_of_modes()` method to calculate a
        sufficient number.
    integration_order_bfp : int | None
        Order of the method to integrate over the back focal plane of the objective. Typically, the
        higher the order, the more accurate the result, or the region of convergence of the area
        around the focus expands. If `None`, the function tries to figure out a reasonable default
        value for the integration methods "peirce" (default, see below) and "equidistant". For other
        integration methods the order has to be set by hand.
    integration_method_bfp : str
        The method of integrating over the back focal plane. The default is "peirce", which is a
        Gaussian-Legendre-like integration method. Other options are "lether", "equidistant" and
        "takaki", see notes below.
    spherical_integration_order : int, optional
        The order of the integration. If no order is given, the code will determine an order based
        on the number of orders in the Mie solution. If the integration order is provided, that
        order is used for Gauss-Legendre integration. For Lebedev-Laikov integration, that order or

        faster for similar precision. However, the order is limited to 131. The Gauss-Legendre
        integration scheme is the next most efficient, but may have issues at a very high
        integration order. In that case, the Clenshaw-Curtis method may be used.

    float | list[float]
        The scattered power in Watts, as a list if multiple positions were given.
