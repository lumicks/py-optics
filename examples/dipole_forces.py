# # Optical forces and the breakdown of the dipole approximation
#
# The dipole approximation treats a bead as an infinitely small particle with a dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$. When this approximation is valid, calculating forces on a bead is fast and convenient. In that case, the force on the particle is proportional to the dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$ and the gradient of the electric field [[1]](#1):
#
# $$F_i = 1 / 2\, \mathrm{Re}\, (p_i^* \nabla E_i),\, i \in x, y, z$$
#
# We assume that the dipole moment induced by the electric field is linear with the electric field itself and shows no anisotropy[<sup id="bh_def_rev">1</sup>](#bh_def):
#
# $$\mathbf{p} = \alpha \mathbf{E} $$
#
# where we have introduced the scalar polarizability of the particle $\alpha$. Then, the force is obtained from [[1]](#1)
#
# $$F_i = \alpha' / 2\, \mathrm{Re}\, \{E_i^* \nabla E_i\} + \alpha'' / 2\, \mathrm{Im}\, \{E_i^* \nabla E_i\}$$
#
# with $\alpha = \alpha' + i\alpha''$
#
# In short: in order to calculate the force on a dipole, only the gradient of the electric field it is in and the polarizability of the particle need to be known. However, the approximation breaks down in a range where optical traps are often used. We will check the applicability of the dipole approximation in the example below.
#
# [<sup id="#bh_def">1</sup>](#bh_def_rev) Note that Ref. [2] defines $\mathbf{p}$ as $\mathbf{p} = \varepsilon_m \alpha \mathbf{E}$, and therefore the definition of $\alpha$ there is slightly modified compared to below</span>

# ## Case 1: small bead, approximation valid
# Let's look at a polystyrene bead of 100 nm diameter, in an optical trap driven by a laser of $\lambda_0 = 1064$ nm. In that case, the bead is about 10x smaller than the wavelength, and as we'll see, the dipole approximation is quite accurate.

lambda_vac = 1064e-9  # 1064 nm laser
n_bead = 1.57  # polystyrene
n_medium = 1.33  # water

# %%
# instantiate a Bead object
small_bead = trp.Bead(
    bead_diameter=bead_diameter, n_bead=n_bead, n_medium=n_medium, lambda_vac=lambda_vac
)
print(small_bead)


# %% [markdown]
# The polarizability of a small bead can be expressed as a function of the refractive index of the particle $n_b$, of the medium $n_m$, and of the size of the bead (radius $r$). A common *approximation* is to use the quasi-static approach, which assumes that the electric field inside the particle is homogeneous. This is a fair approximation as long as the particle is much smaller than the wavelength of the light. In that case [[2]](#2):
#
# $$\alpha_s = 4 \pi \epsilon_0 n_m^2 r^3 (n_b^2 - n_m^2) / (n_b^2 + 2 n_m^2)$$
#
# Here, $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. As even particles made from a perfectly transparent material scatter light, power of the incoming beam is redirected, and this is considered a loss. This is taken into account for the final polarizablility by using the radiation correction [[1]](#1):
#
# $$\alpha = \alpha_s + (i k^3 \alpha_s^2) / (6 \pi \epsilon_0 n_m^2)$$
#
# Here, $k = 2 \pi n_m / \lambda_0$

# ### Objective
# Below we will define some properties of the objective used to exert the force on the particle. Commonly-used objective are of the water immersion type, and have a relatively high Numerical Aperture (NA) of around 1.2. Since only the front of the objective is immersed into water, we also need to specify the refractive index of the medium on the back side, which is typically air. For convenience we will take it to be the same as for vacuum, 1.0.

# Notice how the point spread function is slightly smaller in the $y$-direction than in the $x$-direction, a consequence of the polarized nature of light. Anticipating our results below, we would expect that the forces in the $y$-direction are slightly larger, as the gradient in that direction is steeper.
#
# ### Field gradients
# In order to get the field gradient $\nabla E_i,\, i \in (x, y, z)$, we need to take the derivative of each field component with respect to every coordinate. For example, $\nabla E_x = (\partial E_x/\partial x,\, \partial E_x/\partial y,\, \partial E_x/\partial z)$. Here we can use the fact that we can perform the differentation on the Gaussian beam *before* it enters the objective. As such, we only need to modify the field function, and in the focus we will get the desired derivatives.
