# ## Definition of coordinate system
# The optical axis (direction of the light to travel into) is the $+z$ axis. For an aberration-free system, the focus of the laser beam ends up at $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$ See also below:

#
# ## Properties of the bead, the medium and the laser
# The bead is described by a refractive index $n_{bead}$, a diameter $D$ and a location in space $(x_b, y_b, z_b)$, the latter two in meters. In the code, the diameter is given by `bead_diameter`. The refractive index is given by `n_bead` and the location is passed to the code as a tuple `bead_center` containing three floating point numbers. These numbers represent the $x$-, $y$- and $z$-location of the bead, respectively, in meters. The wavelength of the trapping light is given in meters as well, by the parameter `lambda_vac`. The wavelength is given as it occurs in vacuum ('air'), not in the medium. The refractive index of the medium $n_{medium}$ is given by the parameter `n_medium`.

# %%
bead_diameter = 4.4e-6  # [m]
lambda_vac = 1064e-9  # [m]
n_bead = 1.57  # [-]
n_medium = 1.33  # [-]

# %%
# instantiate a Bead object
bead = trp.Bead(
    bead_diameter=bead_diameter, n_bead=n_bead, n_medium=n_medium, lambda_vac=lambda_vac
)
# Tell use how many scattering orders are used according to the formula in literature:
print(f"Number of scattering orders used by default: {bead.number_of_orders}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Properties of the objective
# See the image below. The definition of the coordinate system remains as before, and the objective is described by the $\mathit{NA}=n_\mathit{medium} \sin(\theta)$, the focal length $f$ in meters, and the medium at the back focal plane (BFP), $n_\mathit{bfp}$. The parameter `NA` sets the $\mathit{NA}$ (unitless), `focal_length` sets the focal length $f$ (in meters) and the refractive index of the medium at the BFP, $n_\mathit{bfp}$, is set by `n_bfp` (unitless).

# ## Properties of the input beam
#
# The continuous field distribution at the back focal plane (the input beam, left figure) is discretized with $(2N-1) \times (2N-1)$ samples, counting $N$ sampels from the center to the extremes of the $x$ and $y$ axes (right figure, here $N=9$). The more samples you have, the more accurate the resulting point spread function will represent the continuous distribution. But, the calculation time will increase with $O(N^2)$. You can get away with relatively small numbers as long as the distance between the bead and the focus is not too large. *Do* check for convergence, however, for real applications (see below).
# <figure>

#     <figcaption>Fig. 3: Left - continuous field distribution of the laser beam. Right - discretized approximation</figcaption>
# </figure>
#
# The parameter `bfp_sampling_n` ($=N$) determines the number of samples in the back focal plane. As an approximation of the focus, a higher number of samples is better but quadratically slower. A too low number causes copies of the point spread function to appear. It is therefore best to check for these artifacts by plotting the fields. In this example, the number here is relatively low ($N=9$) for demonstration purposes.
#
# **In general, a convergence check is required to verify the computed results**
